## objective-c excercise: List protocol implementaiton

This protocol implementation excercise is targetted for junior programmers. Project contains List protocol definition and set of unit tests for classes that adopts it. Tasks:

  - At first project is not compiling, due to lack of any class implementing List protocol. Make stub implementation of List protocol and typedef which class should be tested by unit tests in ListTestDef.h file.
  - **Excercise 1:** Write implementation of List protocol using double linked nodes as data containers
  - **Excercise 2:** Write implementation of List protocol using only c arrays as data containers.
  - Your implementation should pass all unit tests
